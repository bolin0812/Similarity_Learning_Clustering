# Similarity Learning based Clustering
The main objective is to build one program to automatically train similarity learning based metrics and apply clustering algorithms with specified metrics to predict clusters.

# Prerequisites
-  The project is developed in a Python environment. 
   - Get the Anaconda Navigator for Python 3.7.3 and up: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
- Create virtual environment to download required libraries. 
   - If you want to create your python's virtual environment, please install and configure virtualenv. 
     You could install virtualenv and create virtual environment `virtualenv venv`. To activate your virtual environment on Windows,  `C:\Users\SomeUser\python_training> venv\Scripts\activate.bat`.
     For more information, please check following [link1](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) and [link2](https://programwithus.com/learn-to-code/Pip-and-virtualenv-on-Windows/).
   - If you want to use Anaconda Navigator to create your conda environment. Please refer the following [link](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/).
- The project requires number of installed libraries such as scikit-learn and xgboost. 
   - In the virtual environment you created, install necessary libraries listed in the file <a href="./requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a>
   `pip install --user -r requirements.txt`
